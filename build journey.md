## Build Steps taken
1. Repurposed the ESP32 from the sensor project for this project.
    - The board still had the sensor project's 'main.py' on it, which
      runs automatically on every boot. Removed it, along with
      'config.py', 'db.py' and 'bme280_float.py'. Kept 'wifi.py' 
      (its 'connect()' function takes the credentials as arguments, 
      so it isn't tied to the sensor project) and left 'boot.py' alone.
    - Confirmed my PC copy of the sensor project's 'node/config.py'
      existed before deleting the board's copy, since it's gitignored
      and not in the repo.
    - Unplugged the BME280 wiring. The sensor project's node is now
      paused (historical data and the deployed dashboard remain intact).
